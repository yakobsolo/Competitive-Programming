## Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: [3,4,5]

Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

Example 2:

![diagram2](![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99880602/193424584-d4b818ae-d3c5-4890-85d1-a0862c3923f1.png))

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Output: [4,5,6]

Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].

1 <= Node.val <= 100
